*BOUND*

When downloading this repository and opening it in Visual Studio 2022, make sure to make /.config/dotnet-tool.json a trusted file by going into its properties.

You may also need to run "dotnet tool restore" in the terminal in the .../Bound path if dotnet cannot find the "mgcb-editor" package (there will be an error message after you try to build it)
